        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the way your personal data is processed, or if you wish
          to exercise your data protection rights, you may contact us using the email address above.</p>
        <h2>3. Personal Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>Koyden collects and processes different categories of personal data depending on how users interact with the
          services. Some data is provided directly by users, while other data is collected automatically for
          operational, security, and legal purposes.</p>
        <h3>3.1 Data You Provide Directly</h3>
        <p>When you create an account or use Koyden’s features, you may provide personal data such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Account information (for example: name, email address)</li>
          <li>Profile information</li>
          <li>Store information provided by sellers (such as store name, description, address, opening hours, and
            contact details if shared)</li>
          <li>Product information published by sellers (including product names, descriptions, prices, media such as
            images or videos, tags, and availability)</li>
          <li>Content submitted through reports, feedback, or support requests</li>
          <li>Records of policy acceptance (for example, the date and time you accepted the Terms of Service and Privacy
            Policy, and the version accepted)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The type and amount of data collected depends on whether you use Koyden as a buyer, seller, or visitor.</p>
        <h3>3.2 Authentication and Account Data</h3>
        <p>Koyden uses a third-party authentication provider to manage account creation and sign-in.</p>
        <p>As part of this process, the following data may be processed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Email address</li>
          <li>Authentication identifiers</li>
          <li>Account status (such as active, deactivated, or pending deletion)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Koyden does not store passwords directly.</p>
        <h3>3.3 Location Data</h3>
        <p>To enable discovery of local stores and products, Koyden processes location-related data provided by sellers,
          including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Store address details (such as city, postal code, and country)</li>
          <li>Geographic coordinates used to display store locations on maps</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Location data is used solely to support app functionality, such as displaying nearby stores and products, and
          is not used for tracking users beyond what is necessary to provide these features.</p>
        <p>If a user chooses to enable location-based search features, Koyden may access the user’s approximate or
          device location, depending on the permissions granted, to display nearby stores or products.</p>
        <p>When a user enables location-based search, the app may access location while the feature is being used (for
          example, to refresh nearby results).</p>
        <p>Koyden does not collect location data in the background unless the user explicitly grants background
          permission and the feature requires it.</p>
        <h3>3.4 Usage and Technical Data</h3>
        <p>When you use the app, certain technical data may be collected automatically, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Device and app interaction data</li>
          <li>Log data related to app performance, security, and abuse prevention</li>
          <li>Approximate network information (such as IP address) for security, fraud prevention, and operational
            purposes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is used to maintain the stability, security, and proper functioning of the services.</p>
        <p>This data may also be used to support automated security and abuse-prevention measures, as described in
          <strong>Section 4.9</strong>.</p>
        <h3>3.5 Billing and Subscription Data (If Applicable)</h3>
        <p>If you are a seller and choose a paid plan, billing and payment processing are handled by a third-party
          payment provider.</p>
        <p>Koyden does not store full payment card details.</p>
        <p>Billing-related data processed by Koyden may include:</p>

        <h3>6.2 Legitimate Interests</h3>

        <h2>7. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>Koyden does not sell personal data to third parties.</p>
        <p>Personal data may be shared only where necessary to operate the services, comply with legal obligations, or

        <h3>7.1 Service Providers and Processors</h3>

        <p>Such providers include, in particular:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clerk</strong> (authentication services), used to manage user registration, sign-in, session
            management, and account security. Data processed may include email addresses, authentication identifiers,
            and security-related metadata. Clerk acts as a data processor or as an independent controller depending on
            the specific processing activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Supabase</strong> (database and backend infrastructure), used to store and manage application data
            such as user accounts, profiles, stores, products, and related operational data. Supabase acts as a data
            processor.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cloudflare</strong> (network, storage, security, and edge services), used for media storage and

        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stripe</strong> (payment and subscription processing), used to manage subscriptions, billing, and
            payment transactions. Stripe processes payment-related data as an independent data controller in accordance
            with its own privacy policy. Koyden does not store full payment card details.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These service providers act as data processors or independent controllers, depending on their role, and are
          subject to contractual obligations regarding data protection and security.</p>
        <p>Some of these service providers may process personal data outside the European Economic Area; further
          information on international transfers is provided in Section 10.</p>
        <h3>7.2 Payment and Billing Providers (If Applicable)</h3>
        <p>If a seller uses paid features, billing and payment processing are handled by a third-party payment provider.
        </p>
        <p>Koyden may share limited data with this provider, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Account identifiers</li>
          <li>Subscription or plan information</li>
          <li>Billing references required to manage subscriptions</li>

        <h2>9. User Rights (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), users have certain rights regarding their personal data.
          These rights apply subject to applicable legal conditions and limitations.</p>
        <h3>9.1 Right of Access</h3>
        <p>Users have the right to request confirmation as to whether Koyden processes their personal data and, where
          applicable, to access that data.</p>
        <p>This includes information about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The categories of personal data processed</li>
          <li>The purposes of processing</li>
          <li>The categories of recipients of the data</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>9.2 Right to Rectification</h3>
        <p>Users have the right to request correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data.</p>
        <p>Most account, profile, store, and product information can be updated directly through the app.</p>
        <h3>9.3 Right to Erasure (“Right to Be Forgotten”)</h3>
        <p>Users may request deletion of their personal data where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The data is no longer necessary for its original purpose</li>
          <li>The user withdraws consent (where applicable)</li>
          <li>The data has been unlawfully processed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This right is not absolute. Certain data may be retained where required for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Legal or regulatory compliance</li>
          <li>Security and abuse prevention</li>
          <li>Establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>9.4 Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
        <p>Users may request that processing of their personal data be restricted in certain circumstances, such as
          where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The accuracy of the data is contested</li>
          <li>Processing is unlawful but erasure is not requested</li>
          <li>The data is required for legal claims</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>9.5 Right to Data Portability</h3>
        <p>Where applicable, users have the right to receive personal data they have provided to Koyden in a structured,
          commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to transmit that data to another controller.</p>
        <p>This right applies only to data processed based on consent or performance of a contract and by automated
          means.</p>
        <h3>9.6 Right to Object</h3>
        <p>Users may object to processing of their personal data where processing is based on legitimate interests.</p>
        <p>Koyden will assess such requests and will stop processing unless there are compelling legitimate grounds to
          continue or processing is required for legal reasons.</p>
        <h3>9.7 Right to Withdraw Consent</h3>
        <p>Where processing is based on user consent, users may withdraw their consent at any time.</p>
        <p>Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out before the withdrawal.</p>
        <h3>9.8 Right to Lodge a Complaint</h3>
        <p>Users have the right to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection authority if they believe their
          personal data has been processed unlawfully.</p>
        <p>In <strong>Belgium</strong>, this is the Belgian Data Protection Authority. Users may also contact their
          local supervisory authority within the European Union.</p>
        <h3>9.9 Exercising Your Rights</h3>
        <p>Users may exercise their rights by contacting Koyden using the contact details provided in this Privacy
          Policy.</p>
        <p>For security and privacy reasons, Koyden may need to verify the identity of the requesting user before
          responding to a request.</p>
        <p>Requests will be handled within the time limits required by applicable data protection laws.</p>
        <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Koyden operates primarily within the European Union. However, personal data may be transferred to, stored, or
          processed in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) as part of the operation of the services.</p>
        <p>This may occur, for example, when Koyden uses third-party service providers with global infrastructure.</p>
        <h3>10.1 Transfers via Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
        <p>Some of <strong>Koyden’s</strong> service providers may process personal data in countries outside the EEA.
        </p>
        <p>When such transfers occur, Koyden ensures that appropriate safeguards are in place, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Transfers to countries recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data
            protection; or</li>
          <li>The use of approved contractual safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs); or</li>
          <li>Other lawful transfer mechanisms permitted under applicable data protection laws</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In particular, certain service providers used by Koyden, such as authentication, infrastructure, network, or
          payment providers, may process personal data on infrastructure located outside the European Economic Area,
          including in the United States, depending on their service configuration and global operations.</p>
        <h3>10.2 Safeguards and Compliance</h3>
        <p>Koyden takes reasonable steps to ensure that international data transfers comply with applicable data
          protection requirements and that personal data continues to be protected in accordance with this Privacy
          Policy.</p>
        <p>Where required, additional technical or organizational measures may be implemented to protect transferred
          data.</p>
        <h3>10.3 Transparency</h3>
        <p>Users may contact Koyden using the details provided in this Privacy Policy to obtain further information
          about international data transfers and the safeguards applied.</p>
        <h2>11. Data Security Measures</h2>
        <p>Koyden implements appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect personal data against
          unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
        <p>These measures are intended to ensure a level of security appropriate to the nature of the data processed and
          the risks involved.</p>
        <h3>11.1 Technical Safeguards</h3>
        <p>Koyden relies on industry-standard security practices, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Secure communication using encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS)</li>
          <li>Access controls and authentication mechanisms to limit access to authorized users and systems</li>
          <li>Role-based access restrictions within the platform and its infrastructure</li>
          <li>Separation of public and restricted data through database policies and permissions</li>
          <li>Monitoring and logging mechanisms used for security, abuse prevention, and system integrity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Passwords and authentication secrets are not stored directly by Koyden.</p>
        <h3>11.2 Infrastructure and Service Providers</h3>
        <p>Koyden uses reputable third-party infrastructure and service providers to host, process, and deliver parts of
          the services.</p>
        <p>These providers implement their own security measures, which may include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Physical and environmental security controls</li>
          <li>Network security protections</li>
          <li>Data redundancy and backup mechanisms</li>
          <li>Incident detection and response procedures</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While Koyden carefully selects service providers that apply recognized security standards, Koyden does not
          control all aspects of their internal security practices.</p>
        <h3>11.3 Media Storage and Content Delivery</h3>
        <p>User-uploaded media (such as images or videos) may be stored and delivered through external infrastructure
          and content delivery networks.</p>
        <p>Due to the nature of distributed caching systems:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Media may remain temporarily accessible through cached copies after deletion</li>
          <li>Cached content is subject to automatic expiration and invalidation mechanisms</li>
          <li>Koyden does not guarantee immediate global removal of cached content once media is deleted</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Koyden takes reasonable steps to manage media access and visibility but cannot eliminate all residual copies
          instantly due to technical constraints inherent to content delivery systems.</p>
        <h3>11.4 Organizational Measures</h3>
        <p>Access to personal data is limited to individuals who require it for operational, security, or legal
          purposes.</p>
        <p>Koyden applies internal controls designed to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduce unnecessary access to personal data</li>
          <li>Prevent accidental or unlawful processing</li>
          <li>Support data minimization and purpose limitation principles</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>11.5 Security Limitations</h3>
        <p>Despite reasonable safeguards, no system can be guaranteed to be fully secure.</p>
        <p>Koyden cannot warrant or guarantee absolute security of personal data and encourages users to take
          appropriate precautions when using the services.</p>
        <h2>12. Children’s Data</h2>
        <p>Koyden is not intended for use by children under the age of 16.</p>
        <p>Koyden does not knowingly collect or process personal data from children under 16.</p>
        <p>If Koyden becomes aware that personal data of a child under 16 has been collected without an appropriate
          legal basis, steps will be taken to delete such data as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>If you are a parent or legal guardian and believe that a child has provided personal data to Koyden, please
          contact us using the contact details provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Koyden may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Changes in legal or regulatory requirements</li>

          <li>Where required by law, users will be notified of material changes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Continued use of the services after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy, subject
          to applicable legal requirements.</p>

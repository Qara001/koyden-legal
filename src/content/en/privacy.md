Different categories of users may provide different types of data, depending on how they interact with the services.

Where local laws provide additional or mandatory protections, those protections apply accordingly.

## 2. Who We Are (Data Controller)

For the purposes of applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the data controller is:

- **Koyden**
- Established in: **Belgium**
- Contact email: **{{contactEmail}}**

As the data controller, **Koyden** determines the purposes and means of processing personal data collected through the **Koyden** mobile application and related services.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the way your personal data is processed, or if you wish to exercise your data protection rights, you may contact us using the email address above.

## 3. Personal Data We Collect

**Koyden** collects and processes different categories of personal data depending on how users interact with the services. Some data is provided directly by users, while other data is collected automatically for operational, security, and legal purposes.

### 3.1 Data You Provide Directly

When you create an account or use **Koyden’s** features, you may provide personal data such as:

- Account information (for example: name, email address)
- Profile information
- Store information provided by sellers (such as store name, description, address, opening hours, and contact details if shared)
- Product information published by sellers (including product names, descriptions, prices, media such as images or videos, tags, and availability)
- Content submitted through reports, feedback, or support requests
- Records of policy acceptance (for example, the date and time you accepted the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, and the version accepted)

The type and amount of data collected depends on whether you use **Koyden** as a buyer, seller, or visitor.

### 3.2 Authentication and Account Data

**Koyden** uses a third-party authentication provider to manage account creation and sign-in.

As part of this process, the following data may be processed:

- Email address
- Authentication identifiers
- Account status (such as active, deactivated, or pending deletion)

**Koyden** does not store passwords directly.

### 3.3 Location Data

To enable discovery of local stores and products, **Koyden** processes location-related data provided by sellers, including:

- Store address details (such as city, postal code, and country)
- Geographic coordinates used to display store locations on maps

Location data is used solely to support app functionality, such as displaying nearby stores and products, and is not used for tracking users beyond what is necessary to provide these features.

If a user chooses to enable location-based search features, **Koyden** may access the user’s approximate or device location, depending on the permissions granted, to display nearby stores or products.

When a user enables location-based search, the app may access location while the feature is being used (for example, to refresh nearby results).

**Koyden** does not collect location data in the background unless the user explicitly grants background permission and the feature requires it.

### 3.4 Usage and Technical Data

When you use the app, certain technical data may be collected automatically, including:

- Device and app interaction data
- Log data related to app performance, security, and abuse prevention
- Approximate network information (such as IP address) for security, fraud prevention, and operational purposes

This data is used to maintain the stability, security, and proper functioning of the services.

This data may also be used to support automated security and abuse-prevention measures, as described in **Section 4.9**.

### 3.5 Billing and Subscription Data (If Applicable)

If you are a seller and choose a paid plan, billing and payment processing are handled by a third-party payment provider.

**Koyden** does not store full payment card details.

Billing-related data processed by **Koyden** may include:

- Subscription status
- Plan type
- Billing identifiers provided by the payment provider

### 7.2 Payment and Billing Providers (If Applicable)

If a seller uses paid features, billing and payment processing are handled by a third-party payment provider.

**Koyden** may share limited data with this provider, such as:

- Account identifiers

Such disclosures are made only where legally required or permitted.

### 7.4 Business Transfers

In the event of a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or sale of assets, personal data may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to applicable data protection laws and appropriate safeguards.

Users will be notified where required by law.

## 8. Data Retention

**Koyden** retains personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

Retention periods vary depending on the type of data and the context in which it is processed.

### 8.1 Account and Profile Data

### 9.5 Right to Data Portability

Where applicable, users have the right to receive personal data they have provided to **Koyden** in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to transmit that data to another controller.

This right applies only to data processed based on consent or performance of a contract and by automated means.

### 9.6 Right to Object

Users may object to processing of their personal data where processing is based on legitimate interests.

**Koyden** will assess such requests and will stop processing unless there are compelling legitimate grounds to continue or processing is required for legal reasons.

### 9.7 Right to Withdraw Consent

Where processing is based on user consent, users may withdraw their consent at any time.

Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out before the withdrawal.

### 9.8 Right to Lodge a Complaint

Users have the right to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection authority if they believe their personal data has been processed unlawfully.

In **Belgium**, this is the Belgian Data Protection Authority. Users may also contact their local supervisory authority within the European Union.

### 9.9 Exercising Your Rights

Users may exercise their rights by contacting **Koyden** using the contact details provided in this Privacy Policy.

For security and privacy reasons, **Koyden** may need to verify the identity of the requesting user before responding to a request.

Requests will be handled within the time limits required by applicable data protection laws.

## 10. International Data Transfers

**Koyden** operates primarily within the European Union. However, personal data may be transferred to, stored, or processed in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) as part of the operation of the services.

This may occur, for example, when **Koyden** uses third-party service providers with global infrastructure.

### 10.1 Transfers via Third-Party Service Providers

Some of **Koyden’s** service providers may process personal data in countries outside the EEA.

When such transfers occur, **Koyden** ensures that appropriate safeguards are in place, such as:

- Transfers to countries recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection; or
- The use of approved contractual safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs); or
- Other lawful transfer mechanisms permitted under applicable data protection laws

### 10.2 Safeguards and Compliance

**Koyden** takes reasonable steps to ensure that international data transfers comply with applicable data protection requirements and that personal data continues to be protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Where required, additional technical or organizational measures may be implemented to protect transferred data.

### 10.3 Transparency

Users may contact **Koyden** using the details provided in this Privacy Policy to obtain further information about international data transfers and the safeguards applied.

## 11. Data Security Measures

**Koyden** implements appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect personal data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

These measures are intended to ensure a level of security appropriate to the nature of the data processed and the risks involved.

### 11.1 Technical Safeguards

**Koyden** relies on industry-standard security practices, including but not limited to:

- Secure communication using encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
- Access controls and authentication mechanisms to limit access to authorized users and systems
- Role-based access restrictions within the platform and its infrastructure
- Separation of public and restricted data through database policies and permissions
- Monitoring and logging mechanisms used for security, abuse prevention, and system integrity

Passwords and authentication secrets are not stored directly by **Koyden**.

### 11.2 Infrastructure and Service Providers

**Koyden** uses reputable third-party infrastructure and service providers to host, process, and deliver parts of the services.

These providers implement their own security measures, which may include:

- Physical and environmental security controls
- Network security protections
- Data redundancy and backup mechanisms
- Incident detection and response procedures

While **Koyden** carefully selects service providers that apply recognized security standards, **Koyden** does not control all aspects of their internal security practices.

### 11.3 Media Storage and Content Delivery

User-uploaded media (such as images or videos) may be stored and delivered through external infrastructure and content delivery networks.

Due to the nature of distributed caching systems:

- Media may remain temporarily accessible through cached copies after deletion
- Cached content is subject to automatic expiration and invalidation mechanisms
- **Koyden** does not guarantee immediate global removal of cached content once media is deleted

**Koyden** takes reasonable steps to manage media access and visibility but cannot eliminate all residual copies instantly due to technical constraints inherent to content delivery systems.

### 11.4 Organizational Measures

Access to personal data is limited to individuals who require it for operational, security, or legal purposes.

**Koyden** applies internal controls designed to:

- Reduce unnecessary access to personal data
- Prevent accidental or unlawful processing
- Support data minimization and purpose limitation principles

### 11.5 Security Limitations

Despite reasonable safeguards, no system can be guaranteed to be fully secure.

**Koyden** cannot warrant or guarantee absolute security of personal data and encourages users to take appropriate precautions when using the services.

## 12. Children’s Data

**Koyden** is not intended for use by children under the age of 16.

**Koyden** does not knowingly collect or process personal data from children under 16.

If **Koyden** becomes aware that personal data of a child under 16 has been collected without an appropriate legal basis, steps will be taken to delete such data as soon as possible.

If you are a parent or legal guardian and believe that a child has provided personal data to **Koyden**, please contact us using the contact details provided in this Privacy Policy.

## 13. Changes to This Privacy Policy

**Koyden** may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect:

- Changes in legal or regulatory requirements

- Improvements in transparency or clarity

When changes are made:

- The updated version will be made available through the app or associated services
- The “Last updated” date at the end of this policy will be revised accordingly
